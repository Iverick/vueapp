## About the project

This project developed purely for sake of exploring the basic functionality of the Laravel and Vue frameworks. It presents a mockup housing marketplace, that is able to display the list of stored properties and detailed description about each property.


## Start the project locally

Best way to run this project is using the preconfigured Laravel Homestead virtual box.

### Required to install

I run it using the following software pack

* Vagrant 2.2.14
* Virtualbox 6.1

To configure Homestead box look the official documentation here - https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/homestead

 
Recommended Homestead web configuration

```
* PHP 5.5.x
* Vue 2.5
* PostgreSQL 9.6 
```

Note: This way, the PostgreSQL database would be installed on your virtual machine, so you have to log into virtualbox environment and run script from there to install additional packages and seed the database.
